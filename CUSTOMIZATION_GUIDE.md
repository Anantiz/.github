# GitHub Profile README Customization Guide

This guide will help you customize your GitHub profile README to create a professional resume-style portfolio.

## Important Note About Username

All references to "Anantiz" in the template files are **intentional and correct**. Since this is the `.github` repository for the user "Anantiz", the username appears in:
- GitHub statistics widgets (`username=Anantiz`)
- Profile view counters
- Repository URLs

**Do NOT change "Anantiz" to a placeholder** - it's your actual GitHub username and needs to stay as-is for the widgets and links to work correctly.

## Quick Start

1. **Replace all placeholder text** in `README.md` with your actual information
2. **Customize the sections** to match your experience and skills
3. **Add your actual projects** in the Featured Projects section

## Section-by-Section Guide

### 1. Header & About Me
- Replace `[Your Name]` with your full name
- Replace `[Your Professional Title]` with your job title (e.g., "Full Stack Developer", "Data Scientist")
- Replace `[Your Location]` with your city/country
- Write 2-3 sentences about your expertise and current focus

### 2. Professional Summary
- Update your years of experience
- Set your current status (e.g., "Seeking opportunities", "Software Engineer at Company X")
- List technologies/skills you're currently learning
- Describe your professional interests

### 3. Technical Skills

#### Skill Badges
Replace the placeholder badges with your actual technologies. Use [Shields.io](https://shields.io/) for custom badges.

**Example badges:**
```markdown
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-informational?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white&color=3776AB)
![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-JavaScript-informational?style=flat&logo=javascript&logoColor=white&color=F7DF1E)
![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/-React-informational?style=flat&logo=react&logoColor=white&color=61DAFB)
![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Node.js-informational?style=flat&logo=node.js&logoColor=white&color=339933)
![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Docker-informational?style=flat&logo=docker&logoColor=white&color=2496ED)
```

Find logo names at [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/).

#### Technologies Lists
Update the bullet points with your actual tech stack:
- **Backend**: Node.js, Python, Java, etc.
- **Frontend**: React, Vue.js, HTML/CSS, etc.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, etc.
- **DevOps/Cloud**: Docker, AWS, Kubernetes, etc.

### 4. Featured Projects

This is the **most important section** for showcasing your work!

For each project:
1. **Replace the project name and link**: Use the actual repository name
2. **Write a compelling description**: Explain what the project does and its value
3. **List the tech stack**: Use inline code blocks for technologies
4. **Add highlights**: List 3 key features or achievements
5. **Update links**: 
   - Repository link: `https://github.com/Anantiz/your-repo-name`
   - Demo link (if available): Link to live demo or video

**Example:**
```markdown

**Tips for selecting projects:**
- Choose 3-5 of your best or most recent projects
- Select projects that showcase different skills

### 5. GitHub Statistics

The statistics are automatically generated using your GitHub username. They're already configured for `Anantiz`.

**Available themes:** `radical`, `dark`, `default`, `highcontrast`, `tokyonight`, `onedark`, `cobalt`, `synthwave`, `dracula`

Change theme by updating:
```markdown
![Your GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=Anantiz&show_icons=true&theme=tokyonight)
```

### 6. Contact Information

Update all contact links with your actual information:
- Email address
- LinkedIn profile URL
- Personal portfolio/website
- Twitter handle
- Discord username

Remove any sections you don't use.

### 7. What I'm Looking For

Write a brief paragraph about:
- Types of job opportunities you're seeking
- Project collaborations you're interested in
- Technologies you want to work with
- Company culture preferences

**Example:**
```markdown
I'm currently seeking full-time opportunities as a Full Stack Developer, 
particularly in startups or mid-size companies working on innovative products. 
I'm passionate about building scalable applications and would love to work with 
modern technologies like React, Node.js, and cloud infrastructure.
